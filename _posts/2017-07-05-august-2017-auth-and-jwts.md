The Seattle Node.js Meetup is pleased to announce our
[meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Node-js/events/241400591/)
on **Tuesday, August 1st**, with two talks discussing the finer points of
authentication with [JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](https://jwt.io/).

As always, you can find all things Seattle Node.js-related at the group website:
[http://seanode.github.io/](http://seanode.github.io/). And you can reach out to
us via email at [{{site.author.email}}](mailto:{{site.author.email}}) or Twitter
at [@{{site.author.twitter}}](https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}).

See you soon!

## Agenda

* **6:30pm - 7:00pm**: Doors open, hang out with your fellow developers. Grab some snacks and beverages courtesy of [Ookla](http://www.ookla.com/).

* **7:00pm - 8:00pm**: Learn the in's, out's, up's and down's of Node.js authentication with JWTs.

* **8:15pm - 8:30pm-ish**: Mingle, mix, chat things Node.js-related and more as we wind down. We will need just a bit of help breaking down the event, so we would appreciate some volunteer assistance at the end by any attendees that can spare a little time and elbow grease.

## Talks

### JWTs Aren’t So Great

**[Randall Degges](https://twitter.com/rdegges) - [Okta](https://www.okta.com)**

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are all the rage in the security world. They’re becoming more and more ubiquitous in web authentication libraries, and are commonly used to store a user’s identity information.

Randall Degges, Developer Advocate at Okta, will walk you through web authentication from the ground up, explaining how it works both with and without JWTs. Along the way you’ll learn why JWTs aren’t as great as you might hear, and learn about better ways to speed up web authentication for your web applications.

Through this talk, you’ll learn:

* How web authentication works
* How HTTP sessions and cookies store information
* How JWTs work
* How JWTs are commonly used in authentication libraries and tools
* Why JWTs are so popular
* Why JWTs aren’t the right solution for most web applications

### Why JWTs are Awesome!

**[Ado Kukic](https://twitter.com/kukicado) - [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)**

In this talk we'll cover what JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are and using JWTs in your applications when it comes to security is awesome. We'll compare and contrast JWTs to the more traditional session based authentication, examine the ecosystem around JWTs including libraries for NodeJs, and show how you can use JWTs in your NodeJs applications.

Ado is a full-stack developer and technical writer at Auth0. Mixing his passion of programming and education, he creates tutorials, courses, and other educational content focusing on security, authentication, and much more. On the front-end, he prefers Angular 2, while on the backend he flip-flops between Node.js and Golang.
