## Talks

### Build a Node.js Application with Elasticsearch

**Trent Swanson - [Full Scale 180](http://www.fullscale180.com/)**

Elasticsearch is a popular open source search and analytics engine built for distributed environments where reliability and scalability are a must. In addition to content indexing and search, many services are using Elasticsearch to data analytics. In this talk we will provide a brief overview of the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana). We will then dive a bit deeper in to Elasticsearch, the javascript SDK, and how this can be used in your next node.js application. You will walk away with a basic understanding of how to build node.js applications with Elasticsearch.

Trent Swanson is a Solutions Architect and Co-founder at Full Scale 180. Prior to Full Scale 180 Trent worked at Microsoft where he started out as an Embedded Systems Specialist and was a Cloud Solutions Architect when he left to start his own business... again.
