## The Road Show

A little more background into the aim of Joyent's [Road Show](http://www.joyent.com/noderoad/about):

> The profile of users developing and deploying Node.js in production is always changing. As new people come to Node, or as the needs of veterans change, it's important for that information to find its way back to the project. Similarly, it's important for those who are deploying Node in production to bring their wisdom to those just starting out. To that end, Joyent is sponsoring Node.js on the Road, a roadshow aimed at keeping the community connected with the project and production users of Node.
> <br />
> <br />
> We'll be bringing speakers from large and small companies alike to share how they're using Node in production. To talk about the where's, why's, and how's of Node fitting and scaling to their companies' needs. Also, they'll be discussing the ways they coordinate with the Node project and the broader community.
> <br />
> <br />
> But this isn't a one way road, we want to hear from you too. We want to know about your uses of Node, where Node is being successful for you, and where your pain points are. The Node project is nothing without this feedback, it's vital to make sure Node is heading in the direction its users need.
> <br />
> <br />
> It's going to be a fun trip. I can't wait to share with you all the exciting things going on with Node, and to get more people involved.
