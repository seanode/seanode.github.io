## Talk

### Open Source Express.js with [Express Gateway](https://www.express-gateway.io) on Kubernetes

Dig deep into API gateways and learn how you can orchestrate multi-cloud
Kubernetes with a hands-on demo. Through this talk, we'll cover:

* What is an API Gateway and why it is so important for microservices

We love building Node.js projects on Kubernetes and you will too!
