## Talks

### The State of Node Security

**[Adam Baldwin](https://twitter.com/adam_baldwin)** - CSO [&yet](https://andyet.com/)

This talk will discuss the current state of node security. How does that compare to 4 years ago when the node security project started. What vulnerabilities and patterns have we found in the hundreds of applications and the thousands of modules we have audited in that time and what you and your organizations can do to reduce risk in those areas.

Adam Baldwin is the Chief Security Officer at &yet and the Team Lead at ^lift security where he helps developers secure all the web things! He is the Founder of the Node Security Project & talks about node security non-stop. In his free time Adam enjoys doing basically the exact same stuff he does for work, also raising chickens, and spending as much time as possible with his wife and 2 children.
