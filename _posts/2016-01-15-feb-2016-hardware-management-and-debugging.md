## Talks

### RackHD: Hardware Management and Orchestration with Node.js

**[Joe Heck](https://twitter.com/heckj)** - Director, Software Engineering - EMC

JavaScript on the server side has become common place, but managing the servers with JavaScript is taking it to a slightly different level. EMC recently agreed to open source the RackHD project ( [https://github.com/RackHD/RackHD](https://github.com/RackHD/RackHD) ) which leverages JavaScript to enable hardware management and orchestration. We will provide a little background on the project, what it is doing, how it is built, and where it is going.

### Debugging Node.js Apps

**[Josh Gavant](https://twitter.com/joshugav)** - Product Manager, Visual Studio - Microsoft

In this session we'll compare and demo several tools available to help developers improve the quality of their Node.js software, including Visual Studio Code's debugging support. We'll also show a couple options to get Node.js apps up and running on Azure fast. Come with your challenges and frustrations and tell us how we can improve Node.js tools!

Josh has been with Microsoft for 6 years, focusing on open source the last 3, first as part of MS Open Tech and now in Visual Studio. He's the product manager for tools for Node.js developers such as Node.js support in VS Code and Visual Studio, and also manages Microsoft's relationship with the Node.js Foundation and community. When not fixing computers, Josh stays busy with his family traveling, reading, and enjoying great music.
