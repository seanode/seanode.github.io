The Seattle Node.js Meetup is kicking things into gear in the new year with a
panel of talks relating to running Node.js in production with real world
challenges like: infrastructure, operations, the cloud, and security.

We are pleased to have Mixpo host the meetup in their brand new offices and
provide us with pizza and beverages as we explore Node.js in the software and
embedded environments.

As always, you can find all things Seattle Node.js-related at the group website:
[http://seanode.github.io/](http://seanode.github.io/). And you can reach out
to us via email [{{site.author.email}}](mailto:{{site.author.email}}) or Twitter

## Panelists

### Security, Enterprise, and the Cloud

**Kyle McFarland - Piper**

The world of enterprise software is riddled with many hurdles. Unlike the fast
paced consumer Internet, engineers in the enterprise space are faced with many
risks to mitigate and requirements to comply with. In this slower moving space
how does innovative technology like Node.js take a stand. Is Node.js ready to
meet the likes of PCI or HIPPA regulations. The team at Piper believes it is.
Piper is preparing by buttoning up security through Passport.js, Oauth2orize,
Helmet, and Lusca modules and hammering down on the data model using the latest
from the JSON schema specification.

Kyle is the technical co-founded at Piper, a company whose mission statement is
"All receipts, everywhere, for everyone". His team is building an intelligent
solution for receipts. The system allows consumers to connect and store digital
receipt data in the cloud through any credit or debit card after every
transaction. They have nicknamed their technology "cloud receipts". Kyle is
designing solutions to integrate with Point of Sale software and is building a
scalable Node.js receipt cloud. He loves the simplicity of Node.js and is
determined to see it gain more traction in enterprise software systems.


### Preparing and Running Node in Production

**Ken Perkins - Rackspace**

Let's dive into what it takes to run your Node.js apps in production. The most
important part of running Node.js is actually not related to Node.js at all;
We'll talk about provisioning assets in the cloud with pkgcloud, configuring
those instances with Puppet, and keeping it running and monitored. We'll also
look at setting up across multiple environments, logging, performance and
diagnosis of what happens when things go wrong.

Ken is a Developer Advocate for Rackspace (focused on Node.js), building the
Rackspace and Openstack SDKs as part of pkgcloud, where he is a core committer.
Prior to joining Rackspace, Ken was a full stack developer at Clipboard (since
acquired by SalesForce) where he built and managed the entire application
architecture and infrastructure from dev to production.


### Node.js at Nordstrom Data Lab

**Jason Wilson, David Von Lehman - Nordstrom**

The Nordstrom Data Lab is building out the next generation recommendations API
for Nordstrom.com and beyond. Recommendo, our flagship product, was built from
the ground up using Node.js and AWS in a little over three months. Since launch
in November we've served up over a billion recommendations and survived Black
Friday and Cyber Monday without breaking a sweat. We'll be sharing some of the
tips and tricks we encountered along the way concentrating on performance
testing, cloud deployment and hosting with Elastic Beanstalk, and hooking Node
up to DynamoDB.

Jason and David are developers in the Nordstrom Data Lab focusing on
infrastructure development for Nordstrom's next generation personalization
platform. Before joining Nordstrom Jason held various engineering roles in
military / defense and gaming. David was previously a member of the Nordstrom
Innovation Lab and prior to that spent several years as an Application Architect
for Nordstrom.com.
