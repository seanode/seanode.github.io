## Talks

### Azure IoT Using Node.js

**[Jeremy Foster](http://codefoster.com/)** - Developer Evangelist [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/)

It's awesome being able to run Node.js on little IoT devices, but when you hook all 
of these chatty, little devices up to a classic server architecture such as a node 
server or even a node cluster, there's a really good chance it's going to fall over 
with a thud. Modern architectures need to have secure device identification, massive ingest, and 
the ability to speak bi-directionally. Oh, and it would be good too if implementing 
all of this doesn't have to feel like brain surgery and would allow us to use 
Node.js end to end.

Enter Azure IoT services. In this presentation, we'll look at the basic Azure IoT service, how to quickly 
implement, manage, and use it from the command line, from simulated devices, from 
real devices, and from other cloud services.
We do more than talk about it too. We'll write it all out in terse, node goodness.

Jeremy studied Computer Engineering and Mathematics in school a long time ago, and 
has thoroughly enjoyed his career course ever since - primarily teaching and software 
development and primarily on the web stack. He gained experience in education, 
aerospace manufacturing, and insurance, and eventually joined Microsoft with the goal 
of informing and inspiring software developers. He authored his first book _CSS for 
Windows 8 App Development,_ published a couple of courses on Pluralsight.com, and 
tries to keep up with audiences via his blog, codefoster.com, and his Twitter feed,
@codefoster. When he's not working, he's working on maker projects, spending time with 
his wife and two sons, hiking and camping, sailing, scuba diving, or working on house 
projects.
