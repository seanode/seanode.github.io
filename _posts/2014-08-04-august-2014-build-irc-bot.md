## Talks

### Let's build an IRC bot!

**[Wraithan](https://twitter.com/wraithan) - New Relic**

Most of us spend our time in Node.js building web servers and APIs. Others use
Node.js for front end tooling. While HTTP is great, we'll branching out and
building IRC bots together. I highly encourage you to bring your laptop and
follow along with me as we go through all the steps to get a bot connected to a
channel and reacting to commands!

[Wraithan](https://twitter.com/wraithan) is a Software Engineer at New Relic
developing the New Relic for Node.js. Wraithan spends much more time than is
reasonable building IRC bots, fiddling with hardware, and working on his open
source projects. He is an organizer for PDX Node and greatly enjoys mentoring
folks.


## Venue / Sponsor

[Formidable Labs](http://formidablelabs.com/) is hosting the event and
providing food and tasty beverages. The Formidable Labs offices are located at: 3601 Fremont Ave. N, #300, Seattle, WA 98103. (AKA the former DevLocal co-working space.)
