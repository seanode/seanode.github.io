## Talk

### Observing Node.js

**[James Snell](https://twitter.com/jasnell), Node.js Technical Steering
Committee**

Improving the observability, monitoring, and profiling of Node.js has been
consistently identified as the key pain point of Node.js in the Enterprise.
We'll walk through efforts underway to improve observability primitives in core
and new tooling designed to make profiling easier.

Bio: James Snell is a core contributor to Node.js, a member of Node.js Technical
Steering Committee, and a manager of community and open source efforts at
