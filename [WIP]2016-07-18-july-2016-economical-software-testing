## Talks

### Economical Software Testing

**[Dan Rathbone](https://github.com/rathbone1200cc)** - Software Engineer [Rathbone Ventures](http://danrathbone.com/)

Testing your software too little or too much can be a costly mistake.  In this talk, 
Dan Rathbone will discuss the expenses and trade-offs of unit, integration, and 
end-to-end testing.  Balancing these test techniques is the key to creating an effective, 
economical test suite.

Dan Rathbone is an independent software engineer living and working in Seattle.  For the 
past few years he's been building node.js web apps for companies large and small.  He's
always happy to make new connections, so feel free to chat with him after the talk.


## Venue / Sponsor

**[Mixpo](http://mixpo.com/) has graciously agreed to host the event and provide
food and tasty beverages. Mixpo's offices are located at: 520 Pike St, Suite
