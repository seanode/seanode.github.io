## Talks

### API Driven Development with GraphQL

**[Travis Webb](https://github.com/tjwebb)** - CEO of http://www.balderdash.io

How can GraphQL make developing APIs faster and cleaner? Why does it simplify mocking
and documenting your backend services? And just what in the world is it, exactly? 

In this talk, we'll explore the basics of GraphQL, why it exists in the first place, 
and how it can make developing your Node applications way more fun. My goal is to 
leave you inspired to try out your own GraphQL experiments.

Travis Webb is a software developer in Norfolk VA. He is the founder of Langa, a 
consulting firm that helps companies succeed with Node.js and open-source software,
creator of Trails.js (http://trailsjs.io), and father of several cats.
