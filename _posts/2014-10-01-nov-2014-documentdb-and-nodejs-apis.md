## Talks

### How to build a Node.js application on top of Azure DocumentDB

**Andrew Liu - [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/)**

Microsoft Azure has a new service DocumentDB - a fully-managed NoSQL document
database-as-a-service offering rich query and transactions over schema-free
data. DocumentDB is an ideal solution for web and mobile applications which
require iterative development and evolving data models.  Unlike other document
databases, DocumentDB is the first of its kind to offer native support for
JavaScript, SQL query and transactions over schema-free JSON documents. By the
end of this talk you will walk away with a basic understanding building a Node.js
web application on top of Azure Websites + DocumentDB.

Andrew is a program manager working on the Azure DocumentDB team at Microsoft,
and has recently fallen in love with Node.js. Before that, he was a software
development engineer working on the e-commerce platform at Amazon.
