## Talks

### Asynchronous Programming with Streamline.js

**[Seth Pollack](https://twitter.com/sethpollack) - [Rival IQ](https://www.rivaliq.com/)**

Node rocks. However, anyone building a non-trivial Node app has to wrestle with the clunkiness of async control flow (callback hell!). After evaluating several approaches, we discovered [Streamline.js](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs), and the results have been SO good for us that we want to spread the word.

Seth is co-founder and head of engineering at Rival IQ. Previously he co-founded V2Green, and prior to that he worked on server technologies at Microsoft (including creating the ASP platform).

## Venue / Sponsors

Disney is hosting us at the 4th and Madison building at: 925 4th Ave, Suite 1600, Seattle, WA 98104. Please take the elevator up to the Disney reception on the 16th floor, were you will then be escorted down to the 10th floor for the actual meetup.
