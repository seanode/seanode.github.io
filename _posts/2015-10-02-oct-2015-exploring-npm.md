## Talks

### Exploring NPM

**[Andrei Kashcha](https://github.com/anvaka)**

I've been watching NPM for several years. At some moment it stopped being just a package manager and turned into something special. A charming living creature. What can data visualizations and graph algorithms tell us about her? Come join me in this 20 minutes exploratory journey.

_Bio_: Hello Friends! My name is Andrei. Originally from Ukraine, I live and work in sunny Seattle. My current focus is javascript performance, data visualization and graphs. Visit my GitHub profile to see it all: [https://github.com/anvaka](https://github.com/anvaka)
