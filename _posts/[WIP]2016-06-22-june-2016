## Talks

### Building Native Mobile Apps with Node.js

**[Bob Dickinson](https://github.com/BobDickinson)** - Founder [Synchro Labs, Inc.](http://synchro.io)

The Synchro mobile application development platform allows enterprise developers to 
quickly and easily build apps that present to end users as native mobile apps, but where 
all of the app code actually runs on a Node.js server. The resulting apps are easier to 
create, easier to integrate, easier to update, and more secure than other cross platform 
app platforms. And everything is based on Node.js. This talk will briefly cover the 
architecture of the Synchro platform and will then dive in to creating a mobile app live!

Bob Dickinson has been a software developer for 25 years, with several periods of also 
being a founder or executive. Three of the startups that he founded have had successful 
exits. He is an enterprise developer, a full-stack web developer, and a native mobile developer 
(iOS, Android, Windows). He's been working with Node.js for the past three years.
