## Talks

### Readable Asynchronous Code

**[Daniel Rathbone](https://github.com/rathbone1200cc)**

Coordinating asynchronous tasks is the core concern of Node.js programming.  Everyone has an opinion on how to do this - over a dozen npm modules attempt to make asynchronous tasks easier.  In this talk, Daniel will compare usage of several popular modules for managing asynchronous control flow and introduce a new module called "easy-async".

Daniel Rathbone is an independent Software Engineer, happily working for clients and writing Node.js code here in Seattle.  He's happy to consider new clients and projects, and he's actively looking for a co-founder for his growing website CarGraph (https://cargraph.com).

### TDD with TypeScript, AngularJS and Node.js

**[Jakub Jedryszek](http://jj09.net/)**

TypeScript helps to develop and maintain large web applications. Strong typing prevents from introducing bugs, but it doesn't mean we can give up on testing. Let's take a look how we can use TDD for building web applications with TypeScript on the client side (with AngularJS) and server side (with NodeJS). In this talk I will prove that TDD is not dead, give you an insight into pile of JavaScript testing frameworks, and show you a few tools that can make Web Developer's life easier.

Jakub Jedryszek works for Microsoft as Software Engineer. Currently he is working on the Azure Portal – the largest and most complex Single Page Web Application in the World written in TypeScript. He is a founder of dotNetConfPL – online conference for .NET Developers. His blog is at jj09.net.

Before Microsoft Jakub developed a Model-Driven Development and Verification Approach for Medical Devices, while working for SAnToS Lab. He was also working as Web Developer for SMT Software, Division of Communications and Marketing at Kansas State University, and PGS Software.
