## Talks

### Developing with Node.js, NoSQL, and Angular 2

**[Nic Raboy](https://github.com/nraboy)** - Developer Advocate [CouchBase](http://www.couchbase.com/)

In this session, we'll talk about what's different about this generation of web 
applications and how a solid development approach must consider the latency, 
throughput, and interactivity demand by users across mobile devices, web browsers, 
and Internet of Things (IoT). We'll demonstrate how to include Couchbase in such 
applications to support a flexible data model and the easy scalability required for 
modern development. We'll demonstrate how to create an application composed of 
Couchbase, Express Framework, Angular 2, and Node.js. Bring your laptop and follow
along!

Nic is a Developer Advocate for Couchbase in the San Francisco Bay Area. He speaks 
at developer conferences, meetups, and community events in addition to mainting a 
blog and writing tutorials and example applications. The core of his work is making 
sure developers and users of Couchbase are successful in whatever it is they're 
working on. On the side, he develops mobile applications for Android and iOS. His 
most successful mobile application is SQLTool, a database editor for Android based 
devices.
