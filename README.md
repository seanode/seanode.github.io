### Create a New Post
We use the [Jekyll Bootstrap][j_bootstrap] project, which has a couple of
helpers to guide you through post creation. Of course, you can always copy
and old post, but here's the friendly, helpful version:

    $ rake post title="Announcing the May Seattle Node.js Meetup"
    Creating new post: ./_posts/2013-04-17-announcing-the-may-seattle-nodejs-meetup.md

From here, you'll get a raw template to fill in:

    ---
    layout: post
    title: "Announcing the May Seattle Node.js Meetup"
    description: ""
    tags: []
    ---
    {% include JB/setup %}

Fill in the description string and and add any number of tags for the event.
Here's an example of a setup:

    ---
    layout: post
    title: "Announcing the May Seattle Node.js Meetup"
    description: "Start your event loops and come out to talk some Node.js!"
    tags: [events, node.js, javascript, meetup]
    ---
    {% include JB/setup %}

### Authoring a Post

Some various tips:

* **Headings start with h2**: We use `h1` (or `#` in markdown) for titles,
  so use  `h2` (or `##` in markdown) or smaller.


## Development

### Installation
#### Ruby
Jekyll is built on Ruby, so that's what we use. Get an RVM environment
fired up:

    # Activate RVM
    $ rvm use 1.9.3

    # Create and activate custom gemset.
    $ rvm create gemset seanode
    $ rvm use 1.9.3@seanode

Install the repo gemset:

    $ PATH/TO/seanode.github.com
    $ rvm gemset import

Highlighted code requires a

#### Python
... and we need Python too for pygments. We recommend a `virtualenv` for
the project. From there, install with pip:

    $ PATH/TO/seanode.github.com
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the Preview Server
Once everything is installed, you can run the preview server to build the site
and host it locally at: <http://127.0.0.1:4000>

    $ rake preview

Note that you may have to kill/restart to see some of your changes.
