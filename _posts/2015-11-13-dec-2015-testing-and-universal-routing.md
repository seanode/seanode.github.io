## Talks

### Beyond TDD - Getting more from your test suite

**[Sam Eubank](https://twitter.com/sameubank)**

* Do you maintain 100% code coverage?
* Do your tests re-run when files change?
* Does your test runner distribute its load across multiple CPUs?
* Do you lint religiously?
* Are your tests fast?
* Is your application fast?

If you answered no to any of these questions, this talk is for you!

_Bio_: Hi, I'm Sam! By day, I'm a Full-stack JavaScript Samurai at eBay, and by
night, I maintain the Exam test framework. My interests include UX, performance,
and automation. I enjoy having test infrastructure that keeps an eye on the
little things so I can focus on the big things.

### Universal Routing

**[Jamie Hoover](https://twitter.com/uipoet)**

A tale of plugging react-router into a hapi server for universal routing with
examples of universal rendering and storing router state in redux. In this talk,
Jamie will introduce ruto, a hapi plugin for universal routing, and highlight a
simple way to manage project tasks with npm.

_Bio_: Jamie helped create products at eBay, Amazon, Yahoo, Yummly and Voicekick
as both an engineer and designer.
