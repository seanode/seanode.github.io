## Talks

### Koa.js: a happy path to async/await

**[Chris Griffing](http://chrisgriffing.com/)** - Software Developer [Fresh Consulting](http://www.freshconsulting.com/)

With the future of Express uncertain, a lot of people are looking for another 
framework to take its place. There are numerous options to choose from with the 
top 2 being Hapi.js and Koa.js. I'm not going to claim one is better than the 
other because the Hapi ecosystem is awesome and thriving. However, I do think 
Koa provides an easier upgrade path to async/await once it is supported in Node.

Chris Griffing is a full stack developer at Fresh Consulting in Bellevue. 
His hobbies include snowboarding, golfing, and going to meetups. Some say that
his beanie is physically attached to his scalp.
