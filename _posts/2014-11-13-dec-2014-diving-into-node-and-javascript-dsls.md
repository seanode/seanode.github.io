## Talks

### Things I Learned While Taking a New Team into Node.js

**[Joseph Heck](https://twitter.com/heckj) - [Renasar Technologies](http://renasar.com/)**

My team and I are all relatively new to Node.js, but not to communities. This
talk is to share a retrospective of lessons learned, things I wish I'd known, a
few "gotchas" and some interesting libraries that we've found while my whole
team made the leap into Node.js and built a new product.

Joe is a founder and VP of Engineering at Renasar Technologies. Before starting
Renasar, Joe was an early employee and VP of Engineering at Nebula, an early
Project Technical Lead in OpenStack, and Director of Cloud and Automation at the
Walt Disney Corporation.

### Creating DSLs with (JavaScript) Object Literals

**Federico Pereiro**

Every application relies on several Domain Specific Languages: HTML templates,
SQL schemas, configuration files, deployment scripts. In this talk, we will look
at how we can use JavaScript's object literals to create our own DSLs. Besides
explaining the advantages of this approach, we will go through many examples,
ranging from HTML generation to server provisioning. More importantly, we will
discuss a couple of useful design patterns in case you want to write your own
DSLs.

Federico is a full-stack JavaScript freelance developer and open source
contributor. Originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina, Federico is now taking his
work on the road, which brings him to distant and exotic places like Seattle.
Prior to this, he was a backend developer at Hinch.as and Inaka, and before that
he worked as a financial analyst.
