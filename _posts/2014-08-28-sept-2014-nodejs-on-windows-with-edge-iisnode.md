## Talks

### Building production websites with Node.js on the Microsoft stack

**[Dan Polivy](http://www.cellartracker.com/content.asp?iContent=11) - CellarTracker**

Node.js on Windows, in production, may not be the most common configuration -- but it's immensely powerful with the help of [edge.js](http://tjanczuk.github.io/edge/), [iisnode](https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode), and other open source projects. In fact, it's a great tool for building highly performant, scalable front- and back-end websites on the Microsoft stack (IIS, .NET, SQL Server, etc.).

In this talk, I'll share some details, tips-and-tricks, and experiences building a production website on Windows, using CellarTracker -- the world's largest collection of community wine reviews and tools for cellar management -- as an example.

Dan is the Director of Engineering at [CellarTracker](http://www.cellartracker.com/), and has spent the past year building out a Node.js stack to power CellarTracker's mobile website and apps. Prior to joining CellarTracker, he spent nearly 10 years working at Microsoft on Windows and Bing.

### Edge.js and IISNode

**[Tomasz Janczuk](https://twitter.com/tjanczuk)**

Tomasz is the creator of [edge.js](http://tjanczuk.github.io/edge/) and [iisnode](https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode) and will do a deep dive on working with .NET running in-process with Node.js and vice-versa with edge.js.


## Venue / Sponsor
