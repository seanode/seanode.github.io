The Seattle Node.js Meetup is pleased announce our
[meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Node-js/events/210808762/)
on **Thursday, Nov. 20** with talks on building Node.js applications around
the DocumentDB NoSQL datastore and authenticating your Node servers. Microsoft
is hosting us at their SLU offices on the west side.

As always, you can find all things Seattle Node.js-related at the group website:
[http://seanode.github.io/](http://seanode.github.io/). And you can reach out to

## Talks

### How to build a Node.js application on top of Azure DocumentDB

**Andrew Liu - [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/)**

Microsoft Azure has a new service DocumentDB - a fully-managed NoSQL document
database-as-a-service offering rich query and transactions over schema-free
data. DocumentDB is an ideal solution for web and mobile applications which
require iterative development and evolving data models.  Unlike other document
databases, DocumentDB is the first of its kind to offer native support for
JavaScript, SQL query and transactions over schema-free JSON documents. By the
end of this talk you will walk away with a basic understanding building a Node.js
web application on top of Azure Websites + DocumentDB.

Andrew is a program manager working on the Azure DocumentDB team at Microsoft,
and has recently fallen in love with Node.js. Before that, he was a software
development engineer working on the e-commerce platform at Amazon.

### Everything you Wanted to Know About Authentication

**[Randall Degges](https://twitter.com/rdegges) - [Stormpath](https://stormpath.com/)**

Authentication is one of the least understood areas in web development -- and
there's a lot to know: how cookies and sessions work, how to properly encrypt
user sessions, how to safely log users in and out of a web application, which
libraries to use, etc.

In this presentation, Randall Degges, Stormpath Developer Evangelist will share
all of the best practices he learned while building Stormpath's Express.js
authentication libraries. In this talk, you will learn how to safely log users
into web applications, secure REST APIs, the low-level details that make this
possible, and which Node libraries you should be using (and where).

He will cover:

* How HTTP authentication works (form based and API based).
* What are cookies, and how do they work?
* How do sessions work?
* What is the best way to store user state in Node applications?
* What sort of encryption should be used to secure client-side cookies?
* Where does SSL fit into the picture?

Randall is a Developer Evangelist at Stormpath, and a happy programmer. He likes
to hack stuff.
