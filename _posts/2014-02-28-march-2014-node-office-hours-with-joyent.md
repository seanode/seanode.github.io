The Seattle Node.js Meetup is kicking off our inaugural "office hours"
event at the [DevLocal](http://devlocal.io/) co-working space, in an informal
evening of hacking on, talking about and interacting with all things Node.js
related on **Wednesday, March 19, 2014** from **5:00 pm - 7:00 pm**.

Hosted by [Formidable Labs](http://formidablelabs.com/) and
[Joyent](http://www.joyent.com/), we're thrilled to have the following speakers from
our full meetup event,
"[Node.js on the Road w/ Joyent &amp; Friends](http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Node-js/events/167600252/)",
stick around another day to provide guidance on the deep, dark internals
of Node.js and large scale application development:

* **[TJ Fontaine](https://twitter.com/tjfontaine)** - Node.js Project Lead, Joyent
* **[Ben Acker](https://twitter.com/nvcexploder)** - Senior Software Engineer, Walmart Labs

We'll also have some of Seattle Node.js community regulars available for
chatting the fine points and nuances of Node.js. The evening will be a very
casual gathering where you can hack on a Node.js project, get help / advice, or
ask any questions you have - cloud, security, DevOps, frameworks, or anything!

Anyone working with (or interested in learning about) Node.js is most welcome.
We'll have a mix of different backgrounds and experience in Node.js and look
forward to everyone sharing what they know and learning at the same time.
