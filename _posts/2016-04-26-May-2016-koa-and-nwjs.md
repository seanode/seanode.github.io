## Talks

### Koa.js: a happy path to async/await

**[Chris Griffing](http://chrisgriffing.com/)** - Software Developer [Fresh Consulting](http://www.freshconsulting.com/)

With the future of Express uncertain, a lot of people are looking for another 
framework to take its place. There are numerous options to choose from with the 
top 2 being Hapi.js and Koa.js. I'm not going to claim one is better than the 
other because the Hapi ecosystem is awesome and thriving. However, I do think 
Koa provides an easier upgrade path to async/await once it is supported in Node.

Chris Griffing is a full stack developer at Fresh Consulting in Bellevue. 
His hobbies include snowboarding, golfing, and going to meetups. Some say that
his beanie is physically attached to his scalp.

### An Introduction to NWjs

**[Rick Patci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patci)** - Instructor [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/)

Not sure how NWjs works? Rick will lead us through a brief workshop on packaging and 
distributing native desktop apps with node. This demonstration will cover shipping 
and application to a Windows 64 OS from OSX.

Currently an instructor for Code Fellows in Seattle, Rick Patci is teaching students 
intermediate software development. He most recently came from a video streaming 
startup, and loves Motown music!
