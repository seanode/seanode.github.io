The Seattle Node.js Meetup is pleased announce our next
[meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Node-js/events/221841666/)
on **Wednesday, May 20** with a great workshop led by [StrongLoop][sl].
We'll get food and beverages thanks to [StrongLoop][sl]. Please bring a laptop
and local Node.js installation (we all have that, right?) so that we can all
code up our own REST APIs!

**Call for Volunteers**: We would appreciate some volunteers to help us
breakdown the venue space after the workshop and give Moz back a sparkly clean
venue. Please tweet / email us or comment on the Meetup event page!

As always, you can find all things Seattle Node.js-related at the group website:
