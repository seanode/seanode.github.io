## Talks

### TaskMill.io

**[Ahmed Kamel](https://github.com/a7medkamel)**

TODO_TBA


### Take your Game into OT

**[Todd Kennedy](https://github.com/toddself)**

The ill-fated Google Wave, and the much more successful Google Docs, are both
based on the concept of real-time collaborative document editing, and they both
rely on an algorithm to seamlessly merge multiple changes to a single document
called Operational Transformation, or "OT." Interest in live collaboration is
growing in the Node community, given the ease of creating real-time applications
with the evented programming model and packages like socket.io. But a lot of the
information available about syncing strategies like OT is hard to understand or
fraught with complex math. This talk will explain how to use OT in real
applications in straightforward language, and also discuss other systems for
coordinating data changes between clients.

Todd is the CTO of Scripto; a company that makes the software which
powers shows like the Late Show, the Daily Show, Last Week Tonight and
others. Previously he led the tech team at Cond√© Nast Traveler, and ran
video syndication products at MTV Networks.
